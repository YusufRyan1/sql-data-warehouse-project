## 🌟 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Yusuf Ryan** — a fresh graduate and aspiring Full-Stack Data Scientist with a passion for turning data into actionable insights and real business value.

My journey started in data analysis, where I built a strong foundation in SQL, Python, and BI tools by working on end-to-end projects involving data cleaning, exploratory analysis, KPI design, and interactive dashboard development. Over time, I expanded into machine learning, developing a deeper understanding of predictive modeling, statistical thinking, and data-driven problem solving.

Currently, I’m strengthening my skills across the full data stack — from analytics and visualization to data engineering foundations such as data modeling, warehousing concepts, and ETL workflows. I enjoy building projects that simulate real business scenarios, especially in domains like e-commerce and sales analytics, where insights can directly influence strategy and performance.

I’m driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and the ambition to design data solutions that are not only technically sound but also impactful and decision-focused.

If you’re interested in collaborating, discussing ideas, or just talking data — you’re always welcome to connect 🚀
